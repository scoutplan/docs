# Editing Events

## [Attaching files](#attaching-files)

You can attach files to events in Scoutplan.
This is useful for sharing flyers, maps, or other information with attendees.
Unit administrators, unit event organizers, and [event-specific organizers](event_organizers.html) can attach files to events.
Files can be public—visible to anyone who can see the event—or private—visible only to event organizers.
Attached files appear as "thumbnail" images on the event page, and attendees can click to view or download them.

To attach a file to an event:

1. Navigate to the event you want to attach a file to.
1. Click the (...) menu in the top right corner, then click **Event settings**.
1. Scroll down to the **Files** section.
1. In either the Public or Private Attachments section, click **Upload files**.
1. Click the **Save Changes** button.

_For security, files are limited to 10 MB and only specific image, PDF, and Microsoft Word formats._
