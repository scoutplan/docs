**Collecting RSVPs**

Certain events require you to know who's planning to attend. This helps you plan for the right number of people and make sure you have enough supplies.
You can collect RSVPs for any event in Scoutplan. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the event you want to collect RSVPs for, click the (...) menu in the top right corner, then click **Event settings**, or...
1. Add an event to the schedule.
1. Turn on the **Requires RSVP** switch.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

You have a few options for how to collect RSVPs:

**Limit headcount**: Set a maximum number of people who can attend. Once the limit is reached, no one else can RSVP.

**RSVP opens on / closes on**: Set a date range when people can RSVP. No one cann respond or change their response outside of this range.

**Costs**: If your event has a cost associated with it, you can set different costs for youth and adult attendees. This helps you keep track of how much money you've collected and how much you're still waiting for. See [Recording Payments](/docs/recording_payments) for more information.
